# Responsive Sidebar & Product Card Experiment

This project is a **responsive website experiment** built to explore how a sidebar or navigation panel interacts with the main content area—especially how opening and closing the sidebar affects layout, spacing, and resizing of the product cards across different screen sizes.

## 🧪 Purpose

The main goal of this project is to:

- Test **responsive layout behavior** when the sidebar opens and closes.
- Observe how the **main content resizes** and adjusts spacing dynamically.
- Ensure **product cards** fill the available space and adapt to screen edges.
- Validate **device-friendliness** across various screen sizes and resolutions.
- Serve as a **learning exercise** for future responsive UI projects.

> ⚠️ Note: This is a personal experiment and part of my ongoing learning journey. It's not a production-ready app, and may include incomplete or experimental features.

## 💡 Why I Built This

I created this to **understand how responsive layouts behave** when components like sidebars dynamically change size. It’s also a good way for me to improve my front-end development skills and try out different animation and layout techniques.
